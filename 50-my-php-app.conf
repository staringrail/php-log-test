# /etc/rsyslog.d/50-my-php-app.conf

# Filter: Route PHP application error logs to a dedicated file.
# This rule specifically targets logs from the 'my_php_app' program (identifier set in PHP's openlog()).
# It matches messages where:
#   - $programname is exactly 'my_php_app'
#   - $syslogseverity is '3' (which is the numeric code for LOG_ERR severity,
#     as seen by rsyslog from PHP's syslog() function).
#
# Action:
#   - Logs matching these criteria are written to /var/log/php_logs/my_php_app_errors.log.
#   - The 'stop' action prevents these logs from being processed by any subsequent
#     rsyslog rules, avoiding duplication in default log files like /var/log/syslog.

# Rule 1: Send errors from 'my_php_app' to a dedicated error log
if $programname == 'my_php_app' and $syslogseverity <= '3' then {
    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/php_logs/my_php_app_errors.log")
    stop
}

# Rule 2: Send all other messages from 'my_php_app' to a general log
if $programname == 'my_php_app' then {
    action(type="omfile" file="/var/log/php_logs/my_php_app_general.log")
    stop
}
